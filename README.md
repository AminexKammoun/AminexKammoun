👋 Hi, I’m @AmineKammoun

👀 I’m interested in QA automation, continuous integration, and improving software quality through automated testing

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Selenium techniques, Appium, Playwright and building robust test frameworks with Java and Cucumber

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation projects that streamline testing processes and enhance software delivery pipelines

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a bug detector, I save projects from bugs daily! 💻🔨🐞🐛
